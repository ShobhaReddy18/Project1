But whether this will actually occur, is currently extremely questionable, because presently, in a totalitarian manner, everything is directed towards interests which are economic, military, political and cultural â€“ as well as towards that which is strict fundamentalist religious-sectarian â€“ and based on enormous lies and devious, misanthropic, criminal and felonious machinations in every imaginable regard. This also means that the population of the USA is spied upon by the secret services and even severely within the neighbourhoods, and so forth, and, in every possible manner being restricted in its freedom, and this is in addition to the violence, as it emerges in some form or other, both openly and covertly.\\ufeff',\n",

Whites were enslaved by blacks first, and for over 150 years. This was when Europeans(the same race that started America and later enslaved Africans) began searching North Africa to establish trade of goods between natives. From the 1520s to the late 1600s whites were enslaved first. Later the tables turned. This boys and girls is called 'Karma.'\\n4. Statistically over 50% of murders in the US alone are from Blacks, despite them making up only 14.1% of the entire US population, while despite whites make up 63% of the US population they only make up 46% of the murders.\\n5. Whites make up 38% of welfare recipients with blacks making up 39%. This doesn't seem extreme until you realize that 39%(blacks) consists of that 14.1%, whith that 38%(whites) making up 63% of the US.

The governments own statistics reveal that children born into fatherless homes are more likely to drop out of school, more likely to have a history of unemployment, high chance of poverty, \\xa0and more likely to serve time in prison - the list goes on and on.\\n\\nWhen we look at the fact that 70% of black children will grow up in a fatherless home compared to 24% of \\xa0white children we see a number that begins to explain WHY black poverty and black crime is so high amongst blacks in America with 70% of black mothers on welfare.\\n\\nComplied with a dysfunctional gangster-rap culture that glorifies promiscuity, drug dealers the abuse of women and the power of the gun, we see a problem beginning to emerge and the reason for the deaths of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown begin to come clear.\\n\\nBlack Americans, a 13% minority, are doing 54% of the dying and probably 54% of the killing. That needs to be said. So now we have black culture of violence financed by the welfare system.\\xa0\\n\\n*CONCLUSION*\\n\\n*Like i said - there WILL BE \\xa0another \"race based case\" sooner or latter - in fact it will NEVER end.
